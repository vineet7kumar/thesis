I am thankful to my supervisor, Laurie Hendren, whose constant encouragement and
guidance not only helped me to understand compilers better, but also helped me
become a better writer and a better presenter.

I would like to give a special thanks to David Grove for suggesting this line of
research and in helping us understand key parts of the \xten language and
implementation.

I am also thankful to the \mclab team for building an amazing framework for
compiler research on \matlab. In particular, I am thankful to Anton Dubrau
(M.Sc.) for helping me understand the \mcsaf and Tamer frameworks, and Xu Li
(M.Sc.) for all the interesting discussions on how to statically compile
\matlab.

Finally, I would like to thank my parents and my brother, who made it possible
for me to pursue my M.Sc. degree.

Apart from all the wonderful people around me, I am thankful to my computers,
\emph{Antriksh}, \emph{Heisenberg}, and \emph{cougar.cs.mcgill.ca} for
tirelessly and reliably crunching numbers day in and day out.
