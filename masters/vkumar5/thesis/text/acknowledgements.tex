I would like to thank my supervisor Laurie Hendren, for 
her support and direction. She also helped greatly
to finish the paper that constitutes the core of this thesis.

I would also like to thank the entire \mclab team.  In particular I
would like to acknowledge contributions by colleagues Jesse Doherty
(M.Sc.) whose \mcsaf framework is the starting point for the Tamer
framework presented in this thesis, as well as Soroush Radpour (M.Sc.),
who provided the kind analysis (with Jesse) and help with the lookup
semantics and implementation. His \mcbench framework provided insights
into the usage of \matlab.

Finally, I would like to thank my friends and family for their
continued support in light of delays, in particular my mother
Dorothee and my girlfriend JC.
