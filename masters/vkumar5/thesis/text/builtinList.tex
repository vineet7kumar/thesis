In the following we provide a list of \matlab builtin functions.
The corresponding numbers show how many callsites there are for the function
within the large set of \matlab programs that can be analyzed by the \mcbench framework.

When selecting the initial set of builtin functions for the 
builtin framework, we use most of the below functions, excluding
dynamic and GUI functions. We added functions corresponding
to \matlab operators, as well as some \rednote{functions} that are very
closely related to functions in the list.
