In this appendix we show the generated mclass propagation tables
for builtins. We categorized the functions into sections
grouping similar functions together. This categorization helped
us organize the builtin functions into a tree structure.

Rows in the tables 
correspond to the mclass of the first argument, columns correspond to
the mclass of the second argument, and the table entries give the mclass
of the result. The labels {\tt i8} through {\tt i64} represent the
mclasses {\tt int8} through {\tt int64}, {\tt f32} is {\tt single},
{\tt f64} is {\tt double}, {\tt c} is {\tt char}, and {\tt b} is {\tt
logical}. {\tt h} refers to function handles. Values labelled {\tt \{\}} refer to the
empty cell array - we use this argument to check whether functions
support cell arrays at all. Some functions allow arbitrary cell arrays,
others only operate on cell arrays of strings (e.g. the string functions).

Entries of the form ``-" indicate that this combination is
not allowed and will result in a runtime error. {\tt N/A} signifies
that the results were inconsistent across different trials, meaning
that there was no exact result found.
